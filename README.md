# FlashCards Starter Kit

### Abstract
This application is playable through the CLI (Command-Line Interface) and simulates a set of flashcards the user will go through to make guesses for each flashcard. For each guess, feedback is given for whether the guess was correct or incorrect. At the end of the flashcard set, it displays the amount of questions answered correctly.
